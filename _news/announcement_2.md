[BonsAPPs](https://bonsapps.eu/), the EU-funded project that supports small and medium-sized businesses, organized a first Open Call looking to select AI Talents, including researchers, PhDs/postdocs, engineers, and data scientists, that would apply the tools available on Bonseyes Marketplace to develop novel AI solutions - **in which [AzurIA](https://www.azuria.earth/) participated**.

When selected, each team **chose a use case (among a predefined set) and during 2 months, followed guided milestones**. Then, each team presented their results during a hackathon in Bologna, with the strongest 10 AI Talents selected to progress to Stage 2.

**Our team composed of 2 research scientists and 1 apprentice (me at the time)** worked on :factory: **Defect Detection of Manufactured items, on edge devices** :factory:.
Unfortunately, we did not make it to the first place, but we were awarded the **2nd place** for our work.

The European **BonsEYEs AI Marketplace project** is very promising, and it was such a great experience being among the first beta testers :smile:
