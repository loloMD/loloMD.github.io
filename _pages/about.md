A young **Machine Learning Engineer**, currently doing a **D.E.S.S in Machine Learning** at [MILA Institute](https://mila.quebec/en/professional-programs/).

From my previous industrial jobs (**2-year prof. experiences**), I have strong experiences in **Computer Vision** & **Deep Learning to the edge** and their respective related subfields.

**Real-time Deep Learning applications, that need to run fast on low-power devices, are my favorite playgrounds**.

Nonetheless, from my **academic background**, I am also interested in **Multimodal algorithms (CV + NLP)** and **Explainability and Adversarial ML**.

## Call for Collaboration

:sparkles: I am looking for an **ML-related internship** for this **Summer 2024**, in the scope of my academic degree (**hence eligible for various fundings**), starting from **May 2024**, minimum duration of **4 months** :sparkles:

***Currently based in Montreal, I am open to on-site or remote opportunities.***
